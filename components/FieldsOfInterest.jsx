                Other than the various engineering disciplines that intrigue me—
                <i>computer, hardware, software, and electrical—</i>there are other fields
                I would like to learn more about, work in, and contribute to. Below are the
                fields in which I wish to work in or explore further in the future as well
                more specific topics and questions that engross me.
